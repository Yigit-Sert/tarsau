# tarsau
The "tarsau" program is a simple archive utility written in C for the Linux (or Unix) operating system. Unlike traditional archive utilities that compress files, "tarsau" focuses solely on combining multiple text files into a single text-based archive file, similar to how tar, rar, or zip works but without compression.
